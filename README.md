This is a total BASIC REST-API made by using just EXPRESS.js (bcoz we just need routing here.!!!)

Routes >>

  - GET    |   "/"     :  Access all data.
  - GET    |   "/:id"  :  Access that piece of data.
  - POST   |   "/"     :  Add a piece to data.
  - PATCH  |   "/:id"  :  Update that piece of data.
  - DELETE | "/:id"    : Delete that piece of data.

**Hell Yeah!**
